#### Athlete-Performance Task

- Task 1:
  
Part A - I am to create a table showing the Top 100 Nigerian Athlete Performances in 2023, from the highest to the lowest World Athletics 'Results Scores', across the following 10 Track & Field Events combined - women's & men's 100m, 200m, 400m, 100/110mH & 400mH

Part B - I am to create a table showing the Top 50 Nigerian Athlete Performers in 2023, from the highest to the lowest World Athletics 'Results Scores', across the following 10 Track & Field Events combined - women's & men's 100m, 200m, 400m, 100/110mH & 400mH

Required Data - Access to the individual 2023 Toplists for all the 10 events for Nigerian Athletes on the World Athletics Toplists Portal, where I found the 'Results Score' column for all Track & Field events on the far right. I included all the data provided in the World Athletics tables in the 2 tables you're creating above

Hint - Select the 'Best by Athlete' tab for the data required for your Top 50 Performers table, and the 'All' tab instead for the data required for your Top 100 Performances table

- Task 2:

Part A - Create a Ranking Points table to show the Top 20 Individual Performers (Athletes) at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest from 19th-27th August, across all Track & Field Events, based on the number of points they each win for their respective countries in all the events each Athlete competes in, assuming they accumulate points in the Finals of each individual and relay event as outlined below
Part B - Create a Ranking Points table to show the Top 10 Countries (Teams) at the World Championships in Budapest, across the 15 Sprint, Hurdles & Relay Events only - Women's & Men's 100m, 200m, 400m, 100/110mH, 400mH, 4x100m Relays, 4x400m Relays AND Mixed 4x400m Relays - assuming all their Athletes accumulate points for them in the Finals of each individual and relay event also as outlined below

Required Data - For the all the results from Budapest, you can use can either the Budapest ’23 World Champs Results link (arranged by each Day of the Event and each Track & Field discipline), OR the WBudapest '23 World Champs timetable (whichever suits you best for the collection of the necessary data)

* Individual Event Ranking Points (per Athlete):  1st – 20, 2nd – 16, 3rd – 12, 4th – 10, 5th – 8, 6th – 6, 7th – 4, 8th – 2
