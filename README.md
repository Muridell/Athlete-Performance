##### Athlete-Performance Task

Part A - I am to create a table showing the Top 100 Nigerian Athlete Performances in 2023, from the highest to the lowest World Athletics 'Results Scores', across the following 10 Track & Field Events combined - women's & men's 100m, 200m, 400m, 100/110mH & 400mH

Part B - I am to create a table showing the Top 50 Nigerian Athlete Performers in 2023, from the highest to the lowest World Athletics 'Results Scores', across the following 10 Track & Field Events combined - women's & men's 100m, 200m, 400m, 100/110mH & 400mH

Required Data - Access to the individual 2023 Toplists for all the 10 events for Nigerian Athletes on the World Athletics Toplists Portal, where I found the 'Results Score' column for all Track & Field events on the far right. I included all the data provided in the World Athletics tables in the 2 tables you're creating above

Hint - Select the 'Best by Athlete' tab for the data required for your Top 50 Performers table, and the 'All' tab instead for the data required for your Top 100 Performances table
